# Basketball Search UI (Flex Layout) 🏀

This is a React-based UI inspired by search result layouts, displaying basketball-related image cards using a flexible and responsive layout.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- React (JSX)
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🎯 Features
- Responsive layout using `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`
- Dynamically resizing card widths
- Image, title, and subtitle shown on each card
- Clean UI with black background and light text
- Mobile-friendly styling

## 💡 Layout Structure
Instead of using grid, this project relies on `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` to allow cards to resize based on available space.  
Each card maintains its content while adapting to screen size.
